# Portfolio Project - A shopping cart using Redux and Material-UI

This project holds the source code for a shopping cart web app built with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app) and the [Fake Store API](https://fakestoreapi.com/). It uses [Redux Toolkit](https://redux-toolkit.js.org/) for its data store and [Material-UI](https://mui.com/) for styling. The project is deployed on [Netlify](https://neilscartapp.netlify.com/).

Some features I would add in the future are:

- Persistence: store cart items in a database
- Payment processing (if it was an actual e-commerce store)
- Auth
